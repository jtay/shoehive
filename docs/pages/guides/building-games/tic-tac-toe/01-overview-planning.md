# Overview and Planning

Before diving into code, let's plan our Tic-Tac-Toe game. A well-designed game starts with clear requirements and an understanding of the design patterns we'll use.

## Game Requirements

Our Tic-Tac-Toe game will include the following features:

- **Two Players**: Support for exactly two players taking turns
- **3x3 Grid**: Standard Tic-Tac-Toe board for placing X and O marks
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players alternate placing their symbols
- **Win Detection**: Check for three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- **Draw Detection**: Recognize when the board is full with no winner
- **Game Reset**: Ability to start a new game after completion
- **Player Forfeit**: Allow players to concede a game

## Design Patterns

We'll implement several important design patterns to create a robust game framework:

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

We'll use Shoehive's event system to communicate between components. Events will be emitted when important actions occur, such as:
- A player makes a move
- The game state changes
- A winner is determined

This pattern decouples the components of our game, making it more maintainable and extensible.

### 2. State Machine Pattern

Our game will have clearly defined states:
- Waiting for players
- Ready to start
- In progress
- Game over

Each state has specific allowed transitions, providing a predictable flow.

### 3. Command Pattern

Player actions like "make move" or "forfeit" will be implemented as commands. This encapsulates requests as objects, allowing us to:
- Validate commands before execution
- Queue commands if needed
- Maintain a history of actions

### 4. Observer Pattern

The game will notify players of changes using an observer pattern. Players "subscribe" to the game and receive updates when relevant events occur.

### 5. Factory Pattern

We'll use a factory pattern to create new game instances, standardizing the initialization process and encapsulating the creation logic.

## Next Steps

Now that we've outlined our requirements and chosen appropriate design patterns, we're ready to set up our project structure and start implementing the game.
