# ðŸ“˜ Default Events

The shoehive package natively exposes a number of events related to the game server lifecycle.

## Event Naming Convention

For example: `player:connected`, `table:player:joined`, etc.

## Using Events

You can listen for these events using the EventBus:

```typescript
import { EventBus } from 'shoehive';

const eventBus = new EventBus();

// Listen for player connections
eventBus.on('player:connected', (player) => {
  console.log(`Player ${player.id} connected`);
});

// Listen for table state changes
eventBus.on('table:state:updated', (table, tableState) => {
  console.log(`Table ${table.id} state updated to:`, tableState);
});

// Listen for card deals
eventBus.on('table:card:dealt', (table, seatIndex, card, handId) => {
  console.log(`Dealt ${card.toString()} to seat ${seatIndex}, hand ${handId}`);
});

// Event pattern usage examples
eventBus.on('player:connected', (player) => {
  console.log(`Player ${player.id} connected`);
});

eventBus.on('table:state:updated', (table, tableState) => {
  console.log(`Table ${table.id} state updated to:`, tableState);
});

// Using constant references
import { TABLE_EVENTS } from 'shoehive';

eventBus.on(TABLE_EVENTS.STATE_UPDATED, (table, tableState) => {
  console.log(`Table ${table.id} state updated to:`, tableState);
});
```

## Debugging Events

The EventBus provides a debug monitoring feature that can help during development:

```typescript
// Enable debug monitoring for all events
eventBus.debugMonitor(true);

// Enable debug monitoring with a filter for specific events
eventBus.debugMonitor(true, (event) => event.startsWith('table:'));

// Disable debug monitoring
eventBus.debugMonitor(false);
```
